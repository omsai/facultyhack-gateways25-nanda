- Qimora Mason, Elizabeth City State University (ECSU), student mentor

## Science Gateway resources

1. JetStream2-GPU
   with non-virtual multi-GPU nodes and 64-bit floating point support (g3.2xl)
   shared between small groups (e.g. 4 students)
   for early project development and exercises
   (g3.2xl has the [most availability](https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/overview/status/#availability-of-scarce-resources)).
   These resources will be used for
   classroom exercises and preliminary capstone project development
1. ACCESS CI allocation on Bridges-2 GPUs for cluster exercises.
   Students can use interactive nodes
   with short walltime and backfill for debugging purposes,
   and non-interactive jobs for scaling their capstone projects.

## Brief biography

<img src="https://github.com/omsai/facultyhack-gateways25-nanda/blob/master/img/pariksheet.png" alt="Pariksheet Nanda" width="200" align="right"/>

Pariksheet studies hostâ€“pathogen interactions
using computational immunology
and network biology techniques.
Pariksheet runs multiscale mathematical models
that simulataneously simulate infection progression
from molecular to multi-organ whole-host levels
on NSF ACCESS clusters.
He is fluent with techniques in
systems biology,
genetics,
genomic sequencing,
proteomics,
and has extensive industry experience
in quantitative optical microscopy
and photo-targeting.
Pariksheet applies
software engineering,
numerical algorithms,
statistical techniques,
and uncertainty and sensitivity analysis
to model and analyze heterogeneous biological and clinical datasets.

Pariksheet is passionate
about making students excited about a career in research computing
and taking advantage of the unique capabilities
provided by our national cyberinfrastructure programs.
Pariksheet is a Carpentries instructor and has taught
[over 20 workshops](http://omsai.gitlab.io/teaching/)
with the Carpentries.
He is interested in improving
interactive teaching exercises and tools
that other faculty have found their students enjoyed,
made the students more productive,
and learning about the type of work
their students found meaningful
and inspired them to engage with relevant material beyond the syllabus.
