\section{Course description}

Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) %
are not just for artificial intelligence (AI) or %
video games!
%
\ul{GPUs now power the worlds fastest supercomputers %
to solve the most computationally difficult, %
mechanistic scientific problems} in %
physics, %
chemistry, %
biology, %
material sciences, %
energy, %
earth and space sciences, %
national security, %
data analytics, and %
optimization.
%
An 8~year, \$1.8~billion effort %
called the Exascale Computing Project %
involving 2,800 scientists and engineers %
recently finished modernizing %
the underlying scientific numerical software %
to efficiently use this new generation of machines %
at more than a billion, billion floating point calculations per second %
referred to as exaflops.
%
While the National Science Foundation (NSF) NAIRR %
and the computing facilities themselves directly grant %
U.S. institutional and industry researchers like you %
\ul{to use these machines for your research projects at no cost, %
you have to do the work showing that %
your computations efficiently use %
multiple GPUs across many computer servers, %
thus scaling to solve large computational problems}.
%
This class will teach you %
computational skills to program for data parallel architecture, %
statistical techniques to tune your model to match heterogeneous datasets, %
testing and feedback %
to regularly verify and improve your software quality, %
and you will solve a real-world research problem with your own faculty mentor.

This course is for undergraduate students, %
graduates students, %
faculty and staff---%
including those working with university research clusters and %
at the Pittsburgh Super Computing center.
%
\ul{Undergraduate students and staff members %
must e-mail the instructor a letter of support from a faculty mentor %
within the first 2 weeks of the course, %
ideally even before the course begins} %
for the instructor to help scope the capstone project %
and to group learners in complementary research areas together.
%
This course does not focus on AI tools---%
there are plenty of courses covering those---%
but instead focuses on high performance computing (HPC) tools %
and HPC numerical libraries %
that can be instrumented for hardware performance analysis.
%
The capstone project is intended to support %
summer NSF research experiences for undergraduates (REU), %
core-facility staff collaborations, %
and preliminary grant work of %
faculty, postdoctoral trainees, and graduate students.

\section{Course prerequisites}

\begin{itemize}
\item \ul{Familiarity with at least one %
  procedural computer programming language} %
  (such as C, C++, C\#, Fortran, Rust, Swift, %
  Python, R, Julia, GNU Octave, MATLAB, %
  Perl, Ruby, Java, Lisp, etc.)

  The class will use C, C++, Python, and %
  a small amount of Bash shell scripting.

  Don't worry about if you do not know any C, C++, or Python; %
  part of your performance engineering training %
  is to become a computer programming polyglot---%
  even professionals use resources like Learn X in Y minutes %
  to refresh themselves on how to do a computing task in a particular language.
\item \ul{Basic statistical knowledge} %
  of mean, median, standard deviation, and L2-norm.

  The class uses these statistical concepts to construct %
  summary functions for matching computational models with datasets; %
  they are also used in performance profiling tools.

  You will likely encounter more advanced statistics and mathematics %
  for your capstone project %
  and the instructor will do their best and work with your faculty mentor %
  to suggest supplementary books, review papers, or other resources %
  and adjust your class assignment commitments for you to pursue them.
\item \ul{A tentative topic for your capstone project}; %
  please suggest a tentative topic with a faculty mentor when %
  contacting the instructor for a permission number to join the course.
  %
  Undergraduates and staff without research faculty mentors %
  or existing, relevant research projects %
  may either work with the instructor to select a faculty mentor %
  and/or to choose a topic that interests you from the list below:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Scaling up data science-centric workflows (with CharlieCloud)
  \item On-demand complexity at scale (with Apptainer, Galaxy, or Maestro)
  \item Mechanistic AI acceleration %
    (with biologically-informed neural networks [BINNs])
  \end{itemize}
  Note that %
  \ul{your topic is expected to change at least somewhat %
  during the first 3~weeks of the course}, %
  therefore your topic is not ``set in stone'' until \Cref{a-gpu}-capstone %
  due at the $4^{\mathrm{th}}$ week of the course.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
No software installation is necessary before the course begins.

\section{Required resources}

\begin{itemize}
\item \ul{Laptop computer to use in class} running an operating system %
  supported for scientific processing and visualization software %
  such as GNU/Linux, macOS, or Windows %
  (namely, ChromeBooks, tablets, and smartphones would likely not be suitable).

  Typically, %
  GNU/Linux is best supported %
  in computationally-intensive scientific computing %
  and immersing yourself using that as your everyday operating system %
  will support a career in this field; %
  several commercial vendors sell GNU/Linux laptops\footnote{%
  % US-based - only GNU/Linux.
  System76, ThinkPenguin, Purism, %
  % US-based - optional GNU/Linux.
  Framework, Malibal, %
  % International.
  NovaCustom, Tuxedo Computers, StarLabs, Slimbook, %
  % Refurbished.
  Technoethical, Vikings, Libiquity, etc.}.
  %
  For the purposes of this class, %
  a laptop GPU with compute capability\footnote{%
  Intel Xe (in Intel Arc GPUs), AMD ROCm, and Nvidia CUDA.} %
  would allow you to develop and test code locally %
  with more control than testing on remote machines.
\end{itemize}

\section{Assessment}

Theoretical portions of assignments will be graded using Canvas, %
however the majority of this course %
consists of practical code exercises %
that will be submitted using the git version control system.
%
These exercises will be tested and graded using %
a custom GitLab-CI runners and repositories %
setup by the instructor, %
necessary for the complex multi-node and multi-GPU environments.
%
There are no planned examinations %
because the capstone project %
sufficiently assesses coursework proficiency.

\section{Learning objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write \ul{per-node vectorized} CPU and GPU code.
  %
  Analyze per-node efficiency using assembly instructions, %
  memory hierarchy, FLOP-memory bandwidth, and %
  compare against algorithmic complexity.
\item Architect \ul{multi-node distributed} software.
  %
  Analyze multi-node bottlenecks using SLURM statistics, %
  Darshan, and HPCToolKit.
\item Fit compute-intensive scientific software %
  to \ul{heterogeneous datasets} %
  using distributed, parallelizable samplers.
\item Develop scientific code specific %
  \ul{unit tests and performance regression tests} %
  for sustainable software.
  %
  Describe and document scientific codes at appropriate levels.
\item Communicate with peers to give \ul{constructive code criticism} %
  using issue trackers, git merge/pull requests, and review comments.
\item Apply the above skills in developing a \ul{capstone portfolio project}.
  %
  Write an NSF ACCESS style report %
  using a scaling study to justify a request for computational resources.
  %
  Oral presentations of capstone progress and final outcome.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Corresponding \ul{learning goals %
are listed at the end of each class} %
in the table in \Cref{sec:course-schedule} Course schedule.

\section{Course topic categories}

The topics covered in this course %
can be thought of as being the following categories of %
the capstone project,
performance optimization, %
software development, %
domain science, and %
cluster administration:

\begin{tikzpicture}[
  root concept/.style={
    minimum size=3cm,
  }

  };
\end{tikzpicture}

\section{Course schedule}%
\label{sec:course-schedule}

\noindent
Classes are on Wednesdays at 13:00--14:50.
%
Broadly speaking, the schedule is divided into two halves:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Intensive instruction of critical skills %
  to support you working on your capstone project, and
\item Advanced topics that may or may not support your capstone project, %
  but that hopefully expand your capabilities.
  %
  You will also present regular progress reports on your capstone project.
\end{enumerate}
